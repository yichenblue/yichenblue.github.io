Welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming PhD student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I'm about to graduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a BSc in Automation. I was fortunate to be advised by Xiaolin Huang, [Fanghui Liu](https://www.lfhsgre.org/index.html), and [Yudong Chen](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yudongchen/) during my undergraduate education.

Research
======
My research interest currently lies in statistical learning theory, focuses on developing a theoretical understanding of modern machine learning systems, using tools from high-dimensional statistics.
